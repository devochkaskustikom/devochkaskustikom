## About Me 🎵

Hi there! I'm **Anatoly** - a 21-year-old developer and music nerd 🎧 who loves building cool things at the intersection of tech and music. 

I specialize in:
- **JavaScript** (and its awesome ecosystem: Node.js, React.js, Next.js)
- Creating web apps that make life easier for musicians and music lovers
- Building tools that help artists share their music with the world 🌍

By day, I work on music licensing and developing a music distribution platform (think ONErpm/DistroKid but with my own twist). By night, you'll find me experimenting with new tech or discovering obscure music genres.
